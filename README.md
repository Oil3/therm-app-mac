## therm-app-mac
Mac OS app for Opgal's "Therm-app" thermal camera. work-in-progress, that works.

Last time I had used my thermapp 25hz was right before the pandemic, clients weren't plentiful.  I had the idea of using this tiny tablet to go ask the nail salon`s manager if she wanted me to _tomarle tu temperatura_.  Good laugh, 36celcius, and almost no battery already.

Since then, blablabla
